Crime on public transportation and in its surroundings is severe in Chicago, posing a threat to consumers and a challenge to law enforcement authorities. Many UChicago students frequently use public transportation and hence are affected by this issue. The objective of this project is to discover patterns in the occurrence of crime on and around public transportation. The insights derived from this analysis should be used to give consumers guidance on the risk related to the route that they are anticipating to take.

This project and repository comprises the following:
